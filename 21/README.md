## HV19.21 Happy Christmas 256

Santa has improved since the last Cryptmas and now he uses harder algorithms to secure the flag.

This is his public key:

```
X: 0xc58966d17da18c7f019c881e187c608fcb5010ef36fba4a199e7b382a088072f
Y: 0xd91b949eaf992c464d3e0d09c45b173b121d53097a9d47c25220c0b4beb943c
```

To make sure this is safe, he used the NIST P-256 standard.

But we are lucky and an Elve is our friend. We were able to gather some details from our whistleblower:

Santa used a password and SHA256 for the private key (d)
- His password was leaked 10 years ago
- The password is length is the square root of 256
- The flag is encrypted with AES256
- The key for AES is derived with pbkdf2_hmac, salt: "TwoHundredFiftySix", iterations: 256 * 256 * 256

Phew - Santa seems to know his business - or can you still recover this flag?
