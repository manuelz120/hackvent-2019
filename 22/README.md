## HV19.22 The command ... is lost

Santa bought this gadget when it was released in 2010. He did his own DYI project to control his sledge by serial communication over IR. Unfortunately Santa lost the source code for it and doesn't remember the command needed to send to the sledge. The only thing left is this file: [thecommand7.data](./a97ef12f-c583-4c54-84e4-68eaa2737bd9.data)

Santa likes to start a new DYI project with more commands in January, but first he needs to know the old command. So, now it's on you to help out Santa.
